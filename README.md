# **RedRoute: Network Shortest Path Finder & Simulator**

**RedRoute** is a conceptual network simulation tool designed to visualize and compute the shortest path between two hosts in a complex network topology. Built using Python, NetworkX, Tkinter, and Matplotlib, **RedRoute** helps users better understand network routing by visualizing paths, nodes, and their interconnections.

## 📌 **Features**

* **Interactive GUI** built with Tkinter, allowing users to select source and destination hosts.
* **Shortest Path Calculation** using NetworkX's graph algorithms to find the optimal route between any two hosts.
* **Dynamic Visualization** of the network topology with Matplotlib, displaying nodes (hosts and switches) and edges (connections) clearly.
* **Red-themed Design** for an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface.

## 📌 **Installation**

### 1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/s-m-quadri/redroute.git
cd redroute
```

### 2. **Install dependencies**

Make sure Python 3.12.9 is installed. Then, install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`requirements.txt` should include:

```txt
networkx
matplotlib
tkinter
```

## 📌 **Usage**

1. Launch the application by running `main.py`:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Select Source and Destination**:

   * Use the dropdown menus to choose the source and destination hosts.

3. **Find the Shortest Path**:

   * Click the "🔍 Find Shortest Path" button to calculate the path.
   * The shortest path will be visualized on the network graph, with red edges highlighting the selected path.

4. **View Status**:

   * The status bar will update to show the progress of the calculation (e.g., "Finding shortest path..." or "Path found: H0 ➜ S0 ➜ S4 ➜ H7").

### 📌 **PyInstaller Executable**

You can also download the **RedRoute** executable built with **PyInstaller**. The `.exe` file, packaged using `setup.spec`, is available in the [Releases](https://github.com/s-m-quadri/redroute/releases) section of this repository.

## 📌 **Network Topology**

The network topology is based on a series of interconnected switches with hosts distributed in a circular pattern. Switches are placed in a structured grid layout to ensure a variety of routing possibilities, which allows the app to find meaningful routing paths between any selected hosts.
